==== Vulnerability Assessments ====
#Vulnerability scanning is often confused with penetration testing. A vulnerability assessment is the
process of identifying, quantifying, prioritizing and reporting vulnerabilities on a target system. In
terms of information security, the primary purpose of conducting a vulnerability assessment is to find
vulnerabilities in the system and to prioritize them so that effective remedial action can be taken. A
penetration test, on the other hand, leans heavily towards exploiting system weaknesses and
confirming that security measures are sufficient to withstand a real attack.

#Search known services on/OS versions/other information found in the last step:
https://www.exploit-db.com/
https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html
#You can use searchploit in the terminal:
	searshsploit [term or list of terms]
	searchsploit -e [term or list of terms] #use //exact // to narrow search
	#The path will have the code in one form or another to read or modify:
		nano $(locate 40614.py)
		-or-
		cp $(locate 40614.py) [new name] 
#If there is a metasploit framework option check:
	msfconole
#NMAP can also be used to check vulnerabilities, but those scripts were included in the previous step.

==== Automating Assessments ====
#Use [[../../Script_to_Rebuild.txt|OpenVAS]]
	sudo gvm-start
	https://127.0.0.1:9392 #Requires username and password, if you forget you can change it:
		sudo gvmd --user=[username] --new-password=[password]
