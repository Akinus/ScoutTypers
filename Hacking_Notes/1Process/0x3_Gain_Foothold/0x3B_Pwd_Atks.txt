====== 0x3B Password Attacks ======
Created Saturday 19 December 2020

==== Generating Passowrd Lists and Cracking Hashes ====
#A dictionary attack involves creating a file of obvious or popular passwords, such as commonly used
passwords, names and simple variations of specific data. Effective dictionary files are not based on
uneducated guessing but combine reasoning and research for optimal results.

1. Determine password policies. (Include lockout as well, switch to //**spraying**//?)
2. Collect information on targeted users or find keywords in their website.
	//cewl -d [max links] -m [min word length] -w cewl1.txt [website]//
	
3. Extend the file with modified dictionary entries.
	//crunch [min length] [max length] [charset] [options] -o wordlist1.txt//
	
	#Crunch uses character sets in entirety so it's useful to have a list you can easily copy
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	0123456789 
	
	#Use the @ symbol to denote which symbols you want modified like @@@@1980 will do four characters and add 1980 (someones birthday) to the end.
4. Use the wordlist in a password attacking tool or use the default rockyou option.
	//sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-SHA1-AxCrypt hash1.txt//
		#hash1.txt is a list of hashes that we want cracked.
	//sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --rules pwd.txt --fork=10//
	//sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000000.txt --rules pwd.txt --fork=10//

	//hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 kali/Desktop/hash1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt//
		# -m 1800 designates the type of hash we are cracking (SHA512); Find more explanations here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes
		# -a 0 designates a dictionary attack; a 3 is a brute force attack.
		#hash1.txt is a list of hashes that we want cracked.
		

==== Cracking Web Passwords ====
#Burpsuite
1. Set foxy proxy to burpsuite mode.
2. Open burpsuite and attempt to log on.
3. Click send to intruder and then forward the request.
4. Set username then set the password payload to your password list.

#Hydra
1. Intercept the login request with burpsuite.
2. Enter values into your command using hydra.
	//hydra [ip] [form: <url>:<form parameters>:<failure string>:Cookie]//
	
	#An example:
	hydra 10.11.1.250 -t 2 -l admin [-L would specify list] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt [-p would specify a specific word] http-post-form [or http-get-form]
	“/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed”
